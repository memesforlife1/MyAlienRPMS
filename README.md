# MyAlienRPMS
These are PKGBUILDs converted to a .deb with makedeb and then converted to .rpms with alien

**Please Note that if you are on standard Fedora (Not Fedora Rawhide) or OpenSUSE Leap You will have to uninstall these RPMs When Upgrading Versions.** If you are on Fedora rawhide or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Just Update like normal!

Sorry that they're not signed with a GPG key! I'm a kid in the 8th grade so I don't have much time to sign all the packages :(
